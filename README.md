# Happy Hey Day everyone! 
This Wednesday, October 16th is a traditional Auburn celebration called Hey Day.
Originating in 1947, it was created to make soldiers returning from World War II feel more welcomed and comfortable on campus. On Hey Day many students wear name tags and all members of the Auburn community are encouraged to reach out and say "Hey!" to people they don't know.
